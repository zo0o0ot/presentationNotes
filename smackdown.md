#PHP IDE Smackdown#
#[PHPStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)#

Presenter:

+ Ross Larson, developer, Smart Social Media

Background:

+ Pretty new to the PHP scene.
+ ITS Degree from FVTC after non-technical double-major in Psychology/French at Luther College.

Other IDEs and editors I've used:

+ Vim
+ Eclipse
+ Aptana
+ Visual Studio
+ MonoTouch/Mono for Android
+ Notepad++/SublimeText
+ MS Visual FoxPro IDE
+ MS Access
+ SAP Developer Tools

###About:###
+ PHPStorm is a JetBrains product.

##Performance##
+ Fast!
+ I may be biased, running from a fast machine, but the IDE has always been very responsive for me.

##Integration##
Integrates with:

+ twig
+ symfony2
+ markdown
+ github
+ vagrant
+ ssh
+ terminal (zsh for me)
+ SQL stuff
+ CodeSniffer (phpcs)
+ Xdebug

Others:

+ Jira
+ Fogbugz
+ Redmine
+ [Plugin repo](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/phpStorm)

##Developer Experience##
+ Lots of auto-completion options and friendly highlighting.
+ Spell-check!
+ Views are pretty customizable and friendly
+ There are a lot of plugins, but it isn't always natural to install and configure them if you've got other stuff to do.  Some are very friendly, though.  It offered to install the markdown plugin after I created an *.md file.
+ You can learn the existing shortcuts, or customize it to act more like your favorite old-school editor (see: [IdeaVim](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164?pr=phpStorm) or [emacsIDEAs](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7163?pr=phpStorm))
+ Issues: learning curve and trying not to get caught down the rabbit hole of IDE configuration/integration.
+ It costs money, but given the time you spend coding, isn't a better experience and more productivity worth it?
+ It doesn't brew you coffee or make you sandwiches.

##Cool (Mac) shortcuts##
